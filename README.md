Odin Recipe Project

This is the Odin Recipe Project, the first proper assignment/project for the Odin Project's Foundations course. The aim of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far in the course, including the use of the Command Line Interface, Git, and VSCode in creating a basic website coded solely in HTML.
